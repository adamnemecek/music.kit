## Notation

This module provides functions to parse musical entities like pitch or intervals strings into computer manipulable structures (coordinate or properties format)

Currently the strings can be: intervals, degrees, pitches, notes (pitches with duration) and roman numerals (chord degrees).

Those entities can be converted to coordinates or to numerical properties.
